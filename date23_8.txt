###C++
## maps
- in map, when we insert the value with the same key, it will be ignored.


## const, macro, inline



## deque
- we can treat a deque like a double linked list, so it can be manipulate from both of the side.
- some useful syntax for deque:
	- deque<int> mydeque; //Creates a double ended queue of deque of int type
	- int length = mydeque.size(); //Gives the size of the deque
	- mydeque.push_back(1); //Pushes element at the end
	- mydeque.push_front(2); //Pushes element at the beginning
	- mydeque.pop_back(); //Pops element from the end
	- mydeque.pop_front(); //Pops element from the beginning
	- mydeque.empty() //Returns a boolean value which tells whether the deque is empty or not
- if we have an array, we can create a subdeque with specific element from that array by:
	std::deque <int> deques (arr, arr + k);
